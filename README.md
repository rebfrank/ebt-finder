# ebt-finder
A map for EBT card-holders to locate nearby resources. Check it out [here][1].

### Setup

Use `npm install` from within the package directory to install dependencies for running tests. Then use `npm test`.

### Notes

I have only tested this with Chrome. Currently it uses some functions that won't work on older/other browsers, such as fetch.
